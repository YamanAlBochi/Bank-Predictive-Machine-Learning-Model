# Bank-Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model
Background:

A Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that they receive a response immediately after completing their application.

Context: 

- we should understand the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and have an idea of the business needs.

- understand the data.

- prepare for modelling.

- train a model.


In this project, I will make use of automated machine learning as well as traditional machine learning. The Stakeholders, wants to know a few things about the data, also in understanding what machine learning really is with particular use case. I will use Python and its extensive collection of libraries to derive valuable insights from the data, prepare the data and train machine learning models - the old fashioned way and in newer, automated ways.
