# Bank-Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model
Background:

A Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that they receive a response immediately after completing their application.

Context: 

- we should understand the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), and have an idea of the business needs.

- understand the data.

- prepare for modelling.

- train a model.


In this project, I will make use of automated machine learning as well as traditional machine learning. The Stakeholders, wants to know a few things about the data, also in understanding what machine learning really is with particular use case. I will use Python and its extensive collection of libraries to derive valuable insights from the data, prepare the data and train machine learning models - the old fashioned way and in newer, automated ways.

Tasks: 

The Department manager wants to know the following:

1. An overview of the data. (HINT: Provide the number of records, fields and their data types. Do for both).

2. What data quality issues exist in both train and test? (HINT: Comment any missing values and duplicates)

3. How do the the loan statuses compare? i.e. what is the distrubition of each?

4. How do women and men compare when it comes to defaulting on loans in the historical dataset?

5. How many of the loan applicants have dependents based on the historical dataset?

6. How do the incomes of those who are employed compare to those who are self employed based on the historical dataset?

7. Are applicants with a credit history more likely to default than those who do not have one?

8. Is there a correlation between the applicant's income and the loan amount they applied for?
