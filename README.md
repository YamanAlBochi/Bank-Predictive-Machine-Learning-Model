# Bank-Predictive-Machine-Learning-Model
Background:

A Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that they receive a response immediately after completing their application.

-understand the data.
-prepare for modelling.
-train a model.
